            A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek παράγραφος, parágraphos, "to write beside") is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
